What are the main advantages associated with object-oriented programming? <STOP>,Abstraction and reusability. <STOP>,"['Modularability, the ability to reuse parts of the program later in another program sometimes with completely different goals for the program. <STOP> Also it makes it easier to debug code by dividing up the code into classes that each do a specific job and when the program fails at one job you only have one class to debug. <STOP> Good for security purposes because it allows you to let someone use a program which sorts lists without having to give them access to the source code. <STOP> ALso allows you to use inheritance and polymorphism. <STOP>', 'This type of programming is more flexible, making it easier to add and modify the program. <STOP> It is also a type of a fail safe program, you check each individual module. <STOP> This eliminates redundant code and makes the program easier to read for other programmers. <STOP> When debugging the program it is easier to track down the source of a problem within a module rather than a 2 million line program. <STOP>', 'The main advantages to object-oriented programming are that existing classes can be reused and program maintenance and verification are easier. <STOP>', 'The advantages is that OOP allows us to build classes of objects. <STOP> Three principles that make up OOP are: Encapsulation-Objects combine data and operations. <STOP> Inheritance-Classes can inherit properties from other classes. <STOP> Polymorphism-Objects can determine appropriate operations at execution time. <STOP>', 'Some advantages are existing classes can be reused and program maintenance and verification are easier to accomplish. <STOP>', 'Object oriented programming allows programmers to use an object with classes

'One of the main advantages is you can hide inner details a technique known by encapsulation. <STOP> Objects combine the data and operations but you cannot see how it works. <STOP> Another advantage is you can reuse classes that have been defined earlier in the program, a method known as inheritance. <STOP> Finally another advantage is objects can determine appropriate operations at execution time a technique known as polymorphism. <STOP>', 'Existing classes can be reused, and program maintenance and verification are easier. <STOP>', 'Using different modules allows for easier debugging <STOP>', 'Data encapsulation concept, the use of functions or methods to manipulate data. <STOP>', 'Modular, reusable code, allowing faster deployment of solutions, and a more general view of a solution. <STOP>', 'Coding and Debugging programs are usually easier, as either the compiler will specify the object that is working incorrectly, or the function an object was assigned to will be easier to identify. <STOP> The code itself also looks more organized and is easier to read and will help to avoid redundant coding. <STOP> Post-programming maintenance is also easier. <STOP> Also, modules can be reused several times in other programs without too much hassle. <STOP> Abstraction is the art of breaking down one big problem into smaller, simpler problems and solving them. <STOP>

Abstraction and control ... it is possible to isolate elements from other elements a lot easier and prevent tampering of data. <STOP>', 'Encapsulation Objects use operations without knowing how the operation works. <STOP> Inheritance cuts redundancy by reusing earlier classes. <STOP> Polymorphism objects select the correct operation to use in the situation. <STOP>', 'They make it easier to reuse
